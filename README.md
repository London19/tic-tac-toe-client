TIC TAC TOE GAME

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe created with JavaScript and jQuery. This is my first single page application built in General Assembly Software Engineering immersive. My README will show you my story, challenges while I was creating this game.

Technology Used:

•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	JQuery
•	AJAX
•	JSON
•	Bootstrap
•	API

Planning:
I started to plan my game project by drawing out the framework and writing user
stories. Once I had the framwork done.And I carefully read through the
instruction and the requirement of building the game.

Development Process:
I started to build my game by creating all the context in HTML. Right after that,
I built a table using HTML and CSS. Then I started to work on putting value
which is either "X" or "O" in to my table. "X" and "O" would be able to switch
back and forth. Also once the value had been put into the box, it wouldn't be
able to be changed. And then I use JavaScript to write the game logic to be
able to determine who wins, who losts and game ties. And use API for
authetications, click to get game started, and the total number of the user
played. After building the game logics, I did some styling to the interface.

Problem Solving:
This is a challenging project for me. I couldn't figure out how to put "X" or
"O" into my table. After my instructor help me, I finally figured out not only
did I need the value for current player and an empty array for the game board,
and I also needed to take the index of the array and store the value into that
index. Interact with API and AJAX was another big challenge too. I'm glad that
after this project, I've leanred how to ask questions and how to google. And I
got a lot of help form my folks from class and instructors.

Unsolved Problem and Future enhancement:
In the future, I probably will make my code drier and more organized. And also I
would make computer play one role and user play the other.

Framwork and User Story:

1. As a user, I want to be able to sign-up, sign-in to play the game successfully.
2. As a user, I want to know who wins the game or weather or not the game is tie.
3. As a user, I want to start a new game anytime.
4. As a user, I want to know how many games I have been played.
5. As a user, I want to change my password anytime.
6. As a user, I want to be able to sign-out the game anytime.
7. As a developer, I want my users to happily use my application and do all the
the things they want to do.
8. As a developer, I want my application to be easy and safe to use for the users.

Enjoy my game!  https://london19.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/
